# Eklund_Engineering_Notenmachine
elcome to the official repository for Eklund Engineering Notenmachine. This project includes back-ups, examples and documentation.

📦 Project Overview
This repository contains:

🧠 Encoder configuration using Fast Mode
📏 Pulsfactor calculation based on real movement
🔄 Index pulse (Z-pulse) interpretation in Fast Mode
🧰 Git integration with TIA Portal for version control
⚙️ Practical solutions to common TIA V16 errors
🔎 Analysis of module address assignments
📚 Examples of structured FBD/SCL logic
🔧 Technologies Used
Siemens TIA Portal V16
S7-1200 / S7-1500 PLCs
High Speed Counter modules (1-count in Fast Mode)
Git for Windows (for project version control)
⚙️ Encoder Setup (Fast Mode)
This project includes examples of configuring a 1-count HSC module in Fast Mode, interpreting the encoder word from %IW112, and handling the 32-bit status word starting from %ID110.

✅ Z-pulse detection is done using bit 27 of the status word (STS_DI), not a traditional %I110.4 digital input.

📐 Pulsfactor Calculation
We provide logic to calculate how many millimeters per encoder pulse the system moves:

Pulsfactor = Travelled Distance / Number of Pulses This is essential for precise motion scaling and NC integration in custom positioning logic.
